Inventory Ionic App
=====================

Ionic mobile app that displays data from the MongoDB database managed by the Express server in my [inventory-submission](https://github.com/jottorice/inventory-submission) project.

## Reviewing this project (for Coursera reviewers)

Relevant code is mostly in the "www" directory:
* **www/index.html** - top-level HTML page
* **www/js** - app, controllers and services
* **www/templates** - HTML templates for views
